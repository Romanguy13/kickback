# KickBack - CSE115A - Software Engineering Group Project

*Making plans from the group chat to reality!*

## What is KickBack?

KickBack helps to keep track of plans with friends, making the process simple to use and organized. We do this by having an app that stores planned events and lays out clear processes for a user to make an event plan, have members vote, and remind users of such events. This makes the decision-making process less tedious for the host and group, increasing the chance for plans to actually take place.
